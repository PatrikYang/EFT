Your character is a contract operator of a Private Military Company (PMC), caught into the maelstrom of events right after Contract Wars.

Everybody has personal goals now - adapt and survive, exfiltrate the blockade of take control of others' lives by attempting to save them. \n \n \nEvery single game session, be prepared to die and lose everything you had with you. Keep in mind, that every drop in your internet connection or network hardware malfunction can lead to disconnection from the game with consecutive death of you character and loss of all the stuff you had with you or found in the session. \n \nYes, you will die, and, most probably, very often, but remember  - this is still a game.
